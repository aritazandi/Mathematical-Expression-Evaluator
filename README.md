## Mathematical-Expression-Evaluator
This Python script parses and evaluates mathematical expressions using binary trees. It constructs a binary tree from a given mathematical expression, performs a post-order traversal to convert the expression into postfix notation, and then evaluates the postfix expression.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Python script Math (Arita Zandi).py.
3. The script is currently set to evaluate the expression (((a+b)+(c*a))^(-a)) with a=-1, b=2, and c=3. You can modify the expression and variables in the script to evaluate different expressions.

## Features
- Constructs a binary tree from a mathematical expression.
- Converts the expression into postfix notation using post-order traversal.
- Evaluates the postfix expression.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
